# Phase 5: Content Integration - Detailed TDD Implementation

## **CursorAI Development Rules & Context**

### **Mandatory TDD Approach**
```
You must develop in strict TDD mode:
1. Write a failing unit test FIRST
2. Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. Run 'yarn test' to confirm tests pass
4. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
5. Commit the change with a focused message
6. Repeat for the next small change

Never write implementation code before writing the test that validates it.
```

### **Design System Requirements**
Based on design-outline-proposal.md:
- **Colors**: GitHub-inspired palette (#0969da accent, #f6f8fa surfaces)
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono for headings, Inter for body text
- **Animation**: Scroll-triggered with Framer Motion
- **Layout**: Professional, clean, developer-focused aesthetic
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first with 768px, 1024px breakpoints

### **Project Context**
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- shadcn/ui components
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Static export for GitHub Pages
