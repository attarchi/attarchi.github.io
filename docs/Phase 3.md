# Phase 3: Homepage Layout & Structure - Detailed TDD Plan

## **Project Rules for CursorAI** (Add to your project context)

```
DEVELOPMENT RULES:
1. You MUST develop in strict TDD mode
2. For every feature: Write test FIRST ‚Üí Implement code ‚Üí Run 'yarn test' ‚Üí Refactor if needed
3. Make tiny incremental changes (one test at a time)
4. Every component must match the GitHub-style design from design-outline-proposal.md
5. Use JetBrains Mono for headings, Inter for body text
6. Colors: Light (#ffffff bg, #24292f text, #0969da accent) / Dark (#0d1117 bg, #f0f6fc text, #58a6ff accent)
7. All components must be responsive-first
8. Every interactive element needs hover states
9. Confirm each change with 'yarn test' before proceeding
10. Keep commits atomic (one failing test ‚Üí one passing test ‚Üí one commit)
```
