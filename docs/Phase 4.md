# Phase 4: Animation System Implementation
## Test-Driven Development with Micro-Steps

---

## **Project Context for CursorAI**

### **Development Rules to Share with CursorAI:**
```
You should develop in TDD mode using these strict principles:
1. Write a failing test FIRST for the specific functionality
2. Run 'npm test' to confirm the test fails
3. Write the MINIMUM code to make the test pass
4. Run 'npm test' to confirm the test passes
5. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
6. Commit the change with a descriptive message
7. Repeat for the next small functionality

Design Requirements:
- Follow GitHub-style aesthetics: clean, professional, minimal
- Use the exact color palette: #ffffff/#0d1117 backgrounds, #0969da/#58a6ff accents
- Typography: JetBrains Mono for headings, Inter for body text
- Animations should be smooth (60fps), subtle, and enhance UX
- All animations must respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Mobile-first responsive approach

Performance Requirements:
- Use Intersection Observer API for scroll triggers
- Animations should not block main thread
- Lazy load non-critical animations
- Maximum 16ms per animation frame
```

---

## **Step 4.1: Setup Animation Testing Infrastructure**
**Purpose**: Create testing utilities for animation components before building any animations
**Git Commit**: `feat: setup animation testing infrastructure with intersection observer mocks`
**Time Estimate**: 30 minutes

### **CursorAI Prompt:**
```
You should develop in TDD mode. Please prepare unit tests first, then make your changes. Then confirm your changes with 'npm test' command, and then make the next change. Continue this cycle with small changes until everything is correct.

I need to setup testing infrastructure for Framer Motion animations and Intersection Observer API. Create comprehensive test utilities with these requirements:

Testing Infrastructure Needed:
1. Mock Intersection Observer API for Jest environment
2. Framer Motion testing utilities for animation states
3. Custom render function that includes animation providers
4. Matchers for testing animation properties
5. Utilities for testing scroll-triggered animations
6. Performance testing helpers for animation frame rates

Create these files with full test coverage:
- `__tests__/utils/animation-test-utils.ts` - Core animation testing utilities
- `__tests__/utils/intersection-observer-mock.ts` - IntersectionObserver mock
- `__tests__/utils/framer-motion-helpers.ts` - Framer Motion testing helpers
- `jest.setup.js` updates to include animation mocks

Each utility should have its own test file proving it works correctly.

Start with writing tests for the animation testing infrastructure itself, then implement the utilities.
```

### **Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] `npm test` passes with all animation test utilities
- [ ] Intersection Observer mock works in test environment
- [ ] Framer Motion components can be tested without errors
- [ ] Custom matchers work for animation properties
- [ ] All utility functions have 100% test coverage

### **Expected Output:**

```
You should develop in TDD mode. Please prepare unit tests first, then make your changes. Then confirm your changes with 'npm test' command, and then make the next change. Continue this cycle with small changes until everything is correct.

Create a custom hook `useScrollAnimation` that manages scroll-triggered animations with these specifications:

Hook Requirements:

2. Return animation state (visible/hidden) and ref to attach to elements
3. Support custom threshold values (default: 0.2 for 20% visibility)
4. Support custom root margin for early/late triggers
5. Handle cleanup properly to prevent memory leaks
6. Respect prefers-reduced-motion setting
7. TypeScript interfaces for all parameters and return values

API Design:
const { ref, isVisible, hasAnimated } = useScrollAnimation({
  threshold?: number;
  rootMargin?: string;
  triggerOnce?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean;
});


Test Requirements:
1. Hook returns correct initial state
2. Intersection Observer is created with correct options
3. Animation state updates when element becomes visible
4. Cleanup happens on unmount
5. prefers-reduced-motion is respected
6. Multiple instances work independently
7. Edge cases (no IntersectionObserver support)

Start by writing comprehensive tests for all these behaviors, then implement the hook incrementally.
```

### **Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] All hook tests pass with 100% coverage
- [ ] Hook properly creates/destroys Intersection Observer
- [ ] Animation state updates correctly on visibility changes
- [ ] prefers-reduced-motion setting is respected
