## Project Description

This project was developed by Cursor AI with hundreds of prompts as an exercise to understand the abilities and weaknesses of AI editors. Through this experience, I discovered effective practices for using AI-powered development tools in real-world projects.

The portfolio features a **GitHub-style aesthetic** with **interactive scroll animations**, built using modern web technologies and optimized for static deployment. It showcases advanced React patterns, performance optimization techniques, and demonstrates how to leverage AI tools for professional development workflows.

**Key Features:**
- 🎨 **GitHub-inspired design system** with dark/light theme support
- 🚀 **Interactive scroll animations** using Framer Motion
- 📱 **Fully responsive** design for all devices  
- 📝 **Built-in blog system** with Markdown support
- ⚡ **Performance optimized** with Next.js 14 App Router
- 🔄 **Automated deployment** to GitHub Pages
- 🎯 **SEO optimized** with structured data
- ♿ **Accessibility compliant** with ARIA support
- 🧪 **Comprehensive test suite** with Jest and Testing Library

All development experiences and AI collaboration insights are documented in the published blog at [https://attarchi.github.io](https://attarchi.github.io)

## Customization Guide

### Design System
The project uses a GitHub-inspired color palette with full dark/light mode support:

```typescript
// Customize colors in tailwind.config.js
colors: {
  background: 'hsl(var(--background))',
  foreground: 'hsl(var(--foreground))',
  primary: 'hsl(var(--primary))',
  // ... more theme colors
}
```

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: JetBrains Mono (headings, code)
- **Secondary Font**: Inter (body text)
- Customizable through CSS variables

### Animations
All animations are built with Framer Motion and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:

```typescript
// Example animation variant
const fadeInUp = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { duration: 0.6 } }
}
```

## Blog System

### Creating Blog Posts
1. Add new `.md` files to `src/content/posts/`
2. Include frontmatter with metadata:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Your Blog Post Title"
   date: "2025-01-15"
   excerpt: "Brief description of the post"
   tags: ["react", "nextjs", "tutorial"]
   ---
   
   Your content here...
   ```
3. Posts automatically appear on the blog page with SEO optimization

### Current Blog Posts
- **Building Offline-First Apps**: Guide to creating resilient web applications

### Supported Features
- ✅ Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- ✅ Auto-generated table of contents
- ✅ Tag-based filtering
- ✅ Reading time estimation
- ✅ Social sharing buttons

## Testing Strategy

The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

### Testing Guidelines
- **TDD Workflow**: Write test first, then implementation
- **Component Testing**: Test functionality, not appearance
- **Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage
- **Mocking**: Use dedicated mock files for isolated testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Generate coverage report
yarn test:coverage
```

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for any improvements.
This is a showcase project, but contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

### Development Guidelines

1. **Tests**: Remove extra tests; focus on component-specific functionality. Remove CSS-based tests and duplicated logic.

2. **Imports**: Use folder-based imports with index files. All folders should export public components only:
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good
   import { Button } from '@/components/ui'
   
   // ❌ Avoid
   import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button/Button'
   ```

3. **Path Management**: Use `@/*` aliases instead of relative paths beyond one level:
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good
   import { utils } from '@/lib/utils'
   
   // ❌ Avoid
   import { utils } from '../../../lib/utils'
   ```

4. **Content Management**: All content belongs in `src/content/` with proper TypeScript interfaces. Remove hardcoded data from components.

5. **Type Definitions**: Keep types close to their usage. Only use `src/types/` for shared interfaces to avoid circular dependencies.

6. **Component Mocking**: Each component should have a mock version in `__mocks__/` for isolated testing.

7. **Code Cleanup**: Remove unused exports, files, and components. Eliminate unnecessary comments in favor of descriptive naming.

8. **Quality Assurance**: Run `yarn test` and `yarn build` after each change. Fix any breaking changes immediately.

9. **Focused Changes**: Apply improvements only to the specific component/file and its direct dependencies.

10. **Confirmation**: Ensure all changes pass tests and build successfully before submitting.

### Contribution Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes following the guidelines above
4. Run tests: `yarn test && yarn build`
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'feat: add your feature'`
6. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. Submit a Pull Request
